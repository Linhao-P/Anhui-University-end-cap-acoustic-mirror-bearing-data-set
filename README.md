We have released an open end cap acoustic mirror bearing dataset.

We hope this dataset will be useful for your research

Quark disc data: https://pan.quark.cn/s/2b49bb84c07c

The end cap acoustic mirror bearing dataset covers nine combinations of the outer ring, inner ring, rolling body and three types of damage modes of rolling bearing, plus one normal state, a total of 10 kinds of acoustic mirror signals collected.

Three typical failure modes are set for each component: wear (0.5mm mechanical wear mark), pitting (array microhole drilling) and crack (0.2mm wire cutting through joint), and the damaged area is covered along the raceway axis. The corresponding working condition is the spindle speed of 900 r/min and the load of 5kN. The file name is in sequence according to noise-load - speed, for example, no_noise_load_5kn_speed_900rpm.

The file contains four types of damage parts. Healthy bearing is marked N, faulty inner ring bearing is marked I, and faulty outer ring bearing is marked O. "Faulty rolling element bearing" is marked "R". The fault types are denoted by labels, where "00" means no fault, "01,04,07" means wear, "02,05,08" means pitting, and "03,06,09" means crack. These data were sampled at a frequency of 20KHz.
